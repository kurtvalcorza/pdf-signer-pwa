# Phase 0 Research: Portable Offline Desktop Builds

**Feature**: `002-desktop-packaging` | **Date**: 2026-07-17 | **Constitution**: v1.1.0

Resolves every unknown in the plan's Technical Context. Findings are ordered by how much they shape
the design; **R2, R3, and R4 are load-bearing** — getting any of them wrong produces a build that
looks fine and violates a NON-NEGOTIABLE principle silently.

---

## R1 — Runtime shell: Electron vs Tauri

**Decision**: **Electron** + `electron-builder`.

**Rationale**: Principle V (as amended in v1.1.0) now says explicitly that validator evidence is
per-distribution and **cannot be inherited by assertion**, and that a distribution on a different
engine "MUST earn its own passing gate". Both options must therefore run the pyHanko gate. The
difference is what happens when it *fails*: on Electron the engine matches what the 78 existing unit
tests and the Playwright suite already validate, so a failure is a real bug; on Tauri (WebKitGTK on
Linux) a failure could be an engine gap in `canvas`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, WASM, or PDF
rendering, each needing separate diagnosis and possibly a per-engine workaround inside the signing
path — which FR-009 forbids.

We have direct evidence this risk is not hypothetical: 001 already hit `createImageBitmap` working
in Chrome and failing in headless-shell Chromium (`specs/001-pdf-signer/research.md`, deviations).
That was a *Chromium-to-Chromium* difference. A Chromium-to-WebKit difference is strictly larger.

**Cost accepted**: ~150–250 MB per artifact vs ~5–10 MB. Recorded in SC-009 as a documented cost.

**Alternatives considered**:

- **Tauri** — rejected for now, not permanently. Attractive if artifact size ever becomes a real
  user complaint; revisiting means re-earning the Principle V gate on WebKitGTK first.
- **Neutralino / system webview via Go/C#** — same engine-divergence problem as Tauri, smaller
  ecosystem, no gain.
- **PWA install only (status quo)** — already works and remains the primary distribution, but does
  not satisfy the "single file, no URL, air-gapped machine" use case that motivates this feature.

## R2 — Loading the app: custom scheme, NOT `file://`

**Decision**: Serve the built `dist/` over a **custom privileged scheme** (`app://`) registered with
`protocol.registerSchemesAsPrivileged` + `protocol.handle`. Do **not** load `file://`.

**Rationale**: `file://` is not a secure context and is not a "standard" scheme, so ES modules hit
CORS restrictions, the FileSystem/Fetch APIs error, and service workers cannot register. Electron's
docs are explicit that to replace `http` you must register the scheme as **standard**; registering
as standard+secure is what unlocks Fetch API, ServiceWorker registration, and V8 code cache.

**⚠ Load-bearing constraint — `bypassCSP` MUST remain `false`.** The privilege list includes
`bypassCSP`, which "allows resources served through that scheme to bypass Content Security Policy
restrictions". Principle I (v1.1.0) requires the desktop build to keep the CSP **and** add runtime
denial — CSP is not replaced by runtime denial, it is joined by it. Setting `bypassCSP: true` (easy
to copy from a tutorial) would silently disable `connect-src 'none'` and void half of Principle I's
enforcement while every test still passed. This is the single highest-risk line in the feature.

Privileges to set: `{ standard: true, secure: true, supportFetchAPI: true }`. `allowServiceWorkers`
only if R5 concludes we keep the SW. `bypassCSP`, `corsEnabled`, `stream` — not needed; leave unset.

**Handler must be path-safe**: resolve requested paths against the `dist` root and reject anything
escaping it (`..`), so the scheme cannot serve arbitrary host files.

**Alternatives considered**:

- **`file://` + `webSecurity: false`** — rejected outright. Disabling web security to work around a
  loading problem would defeat the CSP that Principle I mandates.
- **Local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`** — rejected. It opens a listening socket, which contradicts
  the spirit of FR-005/FR-006 and gives the app a network surface it currently cannot have.

## R3 — Portable state location (FR-011a/b)

**Decision**: Before `app.whenReady()`, call `app.setPath('userData', <dir adjacent to the
artifact>/data)`, resolving the artifact directory per platform:

| Platform | Source of truth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows portable | `process.env.PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR` | Set by electron-builder's `portable` target |
| Linux AppImage | `dirname(process.env.APPIMAGE)` | `APPIMAGE` holds the **absolute path of the AppImage file** |
| Dev / unpackaged | fall back to Electron default | Keeps `npm run dev` sane |

**Rationale**: relocating `userData` is a **one-line seam that requires zero application-code
change** — `idb-keyval`/IndexedDB in `src/features/persistence/certStore.ts` lives under `userData`,
so it follows automatically. This keeps FR-009 clean (no desktop branch in app code) while
satisfying FR-011a.

**⚠ Load-bearing gotcha — `process.execPath` is WRONG here.** The electron-builder `portable` target
**extracts the app into a temp directory** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\<guid>.tmp\app`) and launches from
there. So `process.execPath`, `__dirname`, and `app.getAppPath()` all point at **temp**, not at where
the user put the `.exe`. Deriving the data directory from any of them would write state into a temp
folder — appearing to work in testing, then losing the user's remembered certificate on the next run
(new GUID), and quietly violating FR-011a. `PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR` exists precisely for this.

Symmetrically on Linux, an AppImage is a mounted squashfs: `process.execPath` points inside the
read-only mount (`/tmp/.mount_XXXX`). `APPIMAGE` is the documented way to get the real file path.
Note `ARGV0` is *not* a substitute — it reports how the AppImage was invoked (and gives the symlink
path when launched through one), whereas `APPIMAGE` is the absolute path of the actual file.

**FR-011b (read-only media)**: if the adjacent directory is not writable, do **not** fall back to the
OS user-data directory — that would leave residue on the host and break SC-005/SC-011. Instead leave
`userData` on a throwaway temp path for the session and surface the memory-only state to the user.
The existing `certStore` already swallows storage failures and degrades silently
(`certStore.ts:16-24`), so the *code* already survives this; the work is making the degradation
**visible** (FR-011b demands a clear explanation, and the current behaviour is deliberately silent).

**Residue caveat (honesty, SC-005)**: the Windows portable target's temp extraction means the app
*does* write its own program files to temp while running; the launcher cleans them up on exit, but a
hard crash can leave them. This is **application code, never user content** (user content stays in
`userData`, which we relocate), so FR-012 is unaffected — but SC-005 must be assessed against *user
data*, and the temp-extraction behaviour should be stated plainly rather than glossed. Do not claim
"leaves absolutely nothing on the machine, ever".

---

## R4 — Runtime network denial + disabling framework phone-home (FR-005/006/007)

**Decision**: Layer four independent controls; do not rely on any single one.

1. **CSP unchanged** — the existing `connect-src 'none'` meta tag in `index.html` ships as-is
   (`bypassCSP` false per R2).
2. **Runtime request denial** — `session.defaultSession.webRequest.onBeforeRequest` cancels every
   request whose scheme is not `app:`/`blob:`/`data:`. This is the "runtime-level outbound denial"
   Principle I (v1.1.0) now mandates for packaged distributions, and it catches anything CSP would
   not (e.g. main-process fetches).
3. **No auto-updater** — `electron-updater` is simply **not a dependency**. FR-007 is satisfied by
   absence, which is stronger than configuration: there is no flag to accidentally flip.
4. **Crash reporter off** — Electron's `crashReporter` does not upload unless `start()` is called,
   so the rule is "never call it". Additionally disable Chromium's own metrics/reporting via command
   line switches, and set `app.setAppLogsPath` expectations so no diagnostics accumulate.

**Also**: block `will-navigate` and `setWindowOpenHandler` to `deny`, so no in-app link can navigate
the window to a remote origin or spawn one.

**Verification (SC-004)** must be observed from **outside** the app — the spec says "not merely
asserted internally". Options: run with no network interface; or assert via Playwright's Electron
driver that no request event escapes. Prefer the former for the release gate.

---

## R5 — Service worker in the desktop build

**Decision**: **Do not register the service worker** in desktop builds. Achieve this with a
build-time flag consumed at the registration call site only.

**Rationale**: The SW exists to make the *web* app work offline by precaching. In a packaged app
every asset is already local and served by our own `app://` handler — the SW would add a second
caching layer with its own invalidation semantics, plus a stale-content risk across versions, for
zero benefit. Keeping it would also force `allowServiceWorkers` on the scheme (more privilege for
nothing).

**FR-009 check**: this touches **registration/bootstrap only, never the signing path**. FR-009
forbids a divergent *signing* implementation; a build-flag at the SW registration site is not that.
Still, it is the one intentional web/desktop divergence in the feature and must be called out in the
plan's Complexity Tracking rather than buried.

**FR-019 check**: implemented as a flag that is **off by default**, so the web build's behaviour is
byte-identical to today unless the desktop build explicitly sets it.

---

## R6 — Local staleness nudge (FR-015a/b)

**Decision**: Inject the build date at **build time** (a Vite `define` constant, sourced from the CI
build timestamp / commit date), compare against `Date.now()` at runtime, and render a passive,
non-blocking notice once past the threshold.

**Threshold**: **180 days (6 months)**. Rationale: Chromium ships stable releases roughly every 4
weeks; six months is ~6 releases behind — late enough to avoid nagging about a fresh build, early
enough that the warning precedes a genuinely ancient engine. Recorded as a named constant so it is
one edit, not a hunt.

**Constraints**:

- **Zero network** (FR-015a) — this is arithmetic on an embedded constant, nothing else. It cannot
  regress into an update check.
- **Clock is untrusted, and that's acceptable.** A user with a wrong system clock gets a wrong nudge.
  The failure is benign in both directions (a spurious notice, or a missing one) and the alternative
  — asking a server for the time — is forbidden. Do not attempt to detect clock skew.
- **Wording** (FR-015b) must say the bundled engine stops receiving security updates, without
  implying a specific known vulnerability.
- Must not block signing.

**Alternatives considered**: shipping an expiry that disables the app — rejected, user-hostile and
would strand an air-gapped user mid-task, which is exactly this feature's audience.

## R7 — Running the signature gate against desktop output (FR-010, Principle V)

**Decision**: Drive the **packaged binary** with Playwright's Electron support
(`_electron.launch({ executablePath })`), complete a real signing flow, capture the output PDF, and
feed it to the existing `scripts/validate_pdf.py` / `npm run verify:signatures`.

**Rationale**: Principle V (v1.1.0) requires evidence from "output actually produced by the artifact
being shipped". Launching the *packaged* binary — rather than Electron-from-`node_modules` against
source — is the only thing that satisfies that wording, and it also exercises `asar` packing, the
`app://` handler, and the `userData` relocation, all of which are exactly where packaging bugs live.

**Reuse**: the existing fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/`: `signature.png`, `e2e-cert.p12` /
`e2e-pass`, `sample-large.pdf`) and `scripts/validate_pdf.py` carry over unchanged. This is a new
harness around existing assertions, not new assertions.

**Cross-platform**: the Windows binary is verifiable natively on the dev machine and in CI; the
AppImage runs in CI's Linux runner. Both must pass before either publishes (FR-010).

---

## R8 — CI build + provenance attestation (FR-018a)

**Decision**: Build both artifacts in GitHub Actions; publish to GitHub Releases with SHA-256
checksums **and** a Sigstore-backed build-provenance attestation.

**Mechanics**:

- Use **`actions/attest-build-provenance`**. Note: as of v4 it is a thin wrapper over
  `actions/attest`, and GitHub now steers new implementations toward `actions/attest` directly —
  either satisfies FR-018a; prefer whichever the docs currently recommend at implementation time.
- Required permissions: **`id-token: write`** (mint the OIDC token for the Sigstore signing
  certificate), **`attestations: write`** (persist it), `contents: read`/`write` (read source /
  upload release assets).
- Attestations bind the artifact's **digest** to a SLSA provenance predicate in in-toto format,
  signed with a short-lived Sigstore certificate.
- Users verify with **`gh attestation verify <artifact> --repo kurtvalcorza/pdf-signer-pwa`**.

**✅ Availability confirmed**: artifact attestations are available on **all current GitHub plans for
public repositories**; private/internal repos require Enterprise Cloud. `pdf-signer-pwa` is public,
so this is free and available — no blocker.

**Why this and not code signing**: an Authenticode certificate proves *who built it*; attestation
proves *what built it, from which commit*. The latter is free, verifiable by anyone, and is the
honest mitigation FR-014 promises in place of a certificate. It does **not** stop the SmartScreen
warning — nothing but a real certificate does. That distinction must not blur in the docs.

**Build matrix**: `windows-latest` for the portable `.exe`, `ubuntu-latest` for the AppImage. Do not
cross-compile; native runners avoid an entire class of toolchain problems for zero cost.

---

## R9 — Not regressing the web build (FR-019)

**Decision**: Desktop packaging is **additive** — a separate `electron-builder` config plus new
main/preload entry points and a separate build script. `vite.config.ts` gains at most the build-date
`define` (R6), which is inert for the web build.

**Guards**:

- Electron and `electron-builder` are **devDependencies** — they must never enter the web bundle.
- The desktop main/preload live outside `src/` (see plan's Structure Decision) so the web build's
  module graph is untouched.
- The existing web gates (`npm run build`, 78 unit tests, `verify:signatures`, Playwright, PWA E2E)
  must stay green and unmodified; SC-008 is measured by exactly that.

---

## R10 — Saving the signed PDF in Electron

**Decision**: Change nothing in app code; let Electron's default download handling show the OS save
dialog.

**Rationale**: the app triggers downloads via a `blob:` URL + `<a download>` (this is also why the
US1 E2E excludes `blob:`/`data:` from its "no external request" assertion — see 001's research). In
Electron this raises the session's `will-download` event, whose default behaviour is a save dialog —
which is the desired desktop UX and requires no code change, preserving FR-009 and FR-020.

**Watch**: `blob:` must be allow-listed in the R4 request filter, or downloads break. This is the
most likely way R4's filter goes wrong.

## Open risks carried into the plan

| Risk | Why it matters | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `bypassCSP: true` copied from a tutorial | Silently voids `connect-src 'none'`; every test still passes (NON-NEGOTIABLE Principle I) | Assert the shipped CSP from inside the packaged app in the E2E gate — do not rely on review |
| Data dir derived from `process.execPath` | Writes state to temp; user silently loses remembered cert; violates FR-011a | Use `PORTABLE_EXECUTABLE_DIR` / `APPIMAGE`; test by running the binary from two different folders |
| R4 filter blocks `blob:` | Signed-PDF download silently breaks | Covered by the desktop E2E, which downloads a real signed file |
| Staleness nudge quietly becomes an update check | Violates FR-006/007 and Principle I | No network client in main; SC-004 observed externally |
| Desktop-only branch creeps into signing path | Voids the entire rationale for Electron over Tauri (R1) | FR-009; flagged in the requirements checklist |
